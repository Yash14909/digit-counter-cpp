# 1-Digit Counter (C++ Program)

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates a **1-digit counter** implemented using a class.  
The counter has the following functionalities:

- Set the counter value (only accepts values from 0 to 9)
- Display the current counter value
- Increment the counter (up to 9)
- Decrement the counter (down to 0)

It also includes basic input validation and boundary checks to ensure the counter stays within a valid 1-digit range.

## ðŸ’» Features

- Encapsulation using C++ classes
- Input validation
- Prevents counter from going below 0 or above 9
